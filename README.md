Reddit Modutils is a tool to assist Reddit community moderators in moderating
their community. At present, it is mostly useful for automatically building
flair templates from existing user flair, however, it can also be used to
quickly list banned users, contributors, and moderators.

Examples (all examples require you to be a moderator for the subreddit)

0. List banned users for subreddit foo

   ```
./modutils.py -l banned foo
```
